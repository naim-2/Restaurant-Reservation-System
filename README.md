# Restaurant-Reservation-System
This is an application project built using Java in Android Studio that allow customers to reserve a table in at least one of three 
restaurants, calculate what they need to pay as well as sending a receipt through a message. The waiters can also set their date and 
times when they will be able to cater for the customers. Each table once taken, cannot be taken by another customer. Error prevention 
methods have also been deployed like picking date and time from a calendar instead of typing it. This was a group project and it was done 
by Sanskruti, Abigia and me.

Dowload and install Android Studio
Download the zipped folder and unzip it OR clone the repository to your local machine
Open the project from within Android Studio
